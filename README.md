# Homebrew Formulae

A [Homebrew Tap](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/docs/How-to-Create-and-Maintain-a-Tap.md) for Rotational Labs tools and libraries.

## Usage

Tap this repository:

```
$ brew tap rotationalio/tools
```

You can then install packages that it contains like any other Homebrew package:

```
$ brew install <formula>
```

If you'd prefer not to tap the repository, you can install tools without tapping as follows:

```
$ brew install rotationalio/tools/<formula>
```

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
